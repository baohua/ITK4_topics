We are developing a new metric framework for ITKv4.  

Goals:

--- easier multi-threading for sliding window metrics 
--- support dense transformations efficiently
--- provide multi-threaded, efficient neighborhood correlation metric
--- support unbiased registration implementation and multi-resolution through the metric's virtual reference space
--- ...
